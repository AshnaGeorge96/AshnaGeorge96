Hi, I'm Ashna George!

 I'm interested in building user-friendly and interactive web applications. I'm particularly passionate about front-end development and the power of JavaScript frameworks like React.

 I'm currently learning React Native to expand my mobile development skills. I'm also diving deeper into UI/UX design principles to create even more engaging user experiences.

Ô∏è I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to front-end development, especially those focused on building accessible and responsive web interfaces. 
 I'm eager to learn from experienced developers and contribute my skills to collaborative projects.
